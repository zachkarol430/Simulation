Simulation of 1000 replicate populations

1.  The number of surviving populations sharply decreases and then slowly decreases over the generations. In the first generation half of the populations are expected to survive. Each generation more populations get wiped out as others stay the same size or grow. Individual populations are not expected to have giant jumps or falls, but becauses there are so many populations some do have big or consecutive falls in population number leading to extinction. The rate of populations dying decreases as there are less populations alive and some of those alive are very large through chance. The graph is cut off early as the number of surviving populations does not change much after, but it does reach 0 sometime past generation 6000. 

2. The average number of individuals in an extant population increases over each generation since some populations grow very large and survive, while other populations die raising the average number of individuals in an extant population. Populations with very low numbers will evenutally die out as well raising the average of number individuals also. In later generations there are very few populations left so the average is high, but these populations will eventually die out given enough time bringing the average to zero.


3.The total number of individuals stays roughly the same(no more than 2600) throughout the generations until generation 5500. This makes sense as the expected value of population change would be 0 if there could be negatives. This is because the probability of replication and death are the same and both result in either a +1 or a -1 outcome. Eventually the total population goes to zero as all the populations go extinct and once extinct can no longer reproduce or die.

Note and patterns:

This problem reminds me of in gambling when people always double their bet. Given enough time if someone starts with a finite amount of money and unlimited rounds of betting they will become bankrupt as a series of losses will bring them to zero which will happen given enough time. Also one thing I noted is the population numbers are all even except generation 0. I think this makes sense as a population of 2 can either -2, 0, +2 and a population of 4 can only -4,-2(3 deaths, 1 reproduce),0,2,4 so the population number stays even.
